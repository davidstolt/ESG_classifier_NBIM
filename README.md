This project is a Streamlit-based tool that uses a MAP–REDUCE LLM pipeline to classify companies according to the NBIM's GPFG exclusion guidelines (§3–4). Users upload annual report PDFs, the system extracts text, splits it into chunks, sends each chunk to the LLM (MAP), merges the signals, and then produces a final classification (REDUCE).
